# Max and Min

The repo implements a python function guided by [these tests](test/max_mintests.py)

The function returns an array containing the min and max number, respectively.

## Why am I doing this?

This labs are part of the Andela boot-camp set of programming assignments, which am currently participating in.

Feel free to comment on the code or ask any questions about the boot-camp.
